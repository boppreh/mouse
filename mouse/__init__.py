mouse
=====

Take full control of your mouse with this small Python library. Hook global events, register hotkeys, simulate mouse movement and clicks, and much more.

_Huge thanks to [Kirill Pavlov](http://kirillpavlov.com/) for donating the package name. If you are looking for the Cheddargetter.com client implementation, [`pip install mouse==0.5.0`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mouse/0.5.0)._

## Features

- Global event hook on all mice devices (captures events regardless of focus).
- **Listen** and **sends** mouse events.
- Works with **Windows** and **Linux** (requires sudo).
- Works with **MacOS** (requires granting accessibility permissions to terminal/python in System Preferences -> Security)
- **Pure Python**, no C modules to be compiled.
- **Zero dependencies** on Windows and Linux. Trivial to install and deploy, just copy the files.
- **Python 2 and 3**.
- Includes **high level API** (e.g. [record](#mouse.record) and [play](#mouse.play).
- Events automatically captured in separate thread, doesn't block main program.
- Tested and documented.

This program makes no attempt to hide itself, so don't use it for keyloggers.

## Usage

Install the [PyPI package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mouse/):

    $ sudo pip install mouse

or clone the repository (no installation required, source files are sufficient):

    $ git clone https://github.com/boppreh/mouse

Then check the [API docs](https://github.com/boppreh/mouse#api) to see what features are available.


## Known limitations:

- Events generated under Windows don't report device id (`event.device == None`). [#21](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard/issues/21)
- To avoid depending on X the Linux parts reads raw device files (`/dev/input/input*`) but this requries root.
- Other applications, such as some games, may register hooks that swallow all key events. In this case `mouse` will be unable to report events.
